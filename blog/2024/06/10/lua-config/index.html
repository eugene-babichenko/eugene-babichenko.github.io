Both pieces of software are designed with great flexibility in mind. And both are configured with <a href=https://lua.org/>Lua</a>. After rocking them for a while, I decided to share my thoughts.<p>This story started with me trying to give the entire Vim thing another shot. Then I remembered that there is Neovim. The interesting thing for me was the first-class LSP support. But then I also remembered it can be configured (or programmed, really) in Lua instead of VimScript, which I think is an utterly horrible programming language which was put in there for the lack of a better alternative at the time.<p>Before that I have used Lua in some obscure robotics platform and it was fine, so I though "why not?". After all, it seemed like a rather small and limited, but still a "proper" programming language. A tiny JS-like thing, if you will. So I decided to go with configuring my Neovim installation in Lua instead of VimScript.<p>Can you imagine my surprise finding an entire Lua-based ecosystem? Everything felt like such a breeze after struggling with VimScript and Emacs Lisp. And quite contrary to my fears about putting an entire proper scripting language into any software, the thing is <em>properly quick</em>. My Neovim installation contains 30+ plugins including dependencies and this thing easily loads in sub-100 (60-70 ms to be precise) milliseconds time. In a blink of an eye really.<p>And then came WezTerm. At the time, I've been looking for an alternative to kitty. The thing worked, it was relatively quick, but it just felt <em>clunky</em> and the way it was configured have been driving me nuts for a while. Like, I have a Python interpreter shipped with this thing, and yet I have to write every <code>CMD+number</code> key binding in a custom config language to get iTerm-like tab switching by hand? Really? But what are the alternatives? Alacritty and the likes of it seems too minimalistic and I am not a fan of tmux. And I would have had to use it because Alacritty lacks any multiplexing capabilities. I moved away from iTerm because of poor rendering perforamce: it is not slow, but it does eat through battery, and this is something important for me. And then I stumbled upon WezTerm on <a href=https://www.reddit.com/r/neovim/>r/neovim</a>. WezTerm allows to neatly fit that in a three-line for-loop because, you guessed it, it's config is a Lua script.<p>If you are building software designed to be used by other engineers and want to bring in a great degree of configurability, Lua is a great choice. It may not be the most powerful or expressive programming language, but the goal is to write scripts, so it doesn't have to be. It promises to be a quick embeddable scripting language and it delivers on this promise. It is simple enough to be learnt in an evening for the purposes of just writing a config. Unlike languages like VimScript or Emacs Lisp it is not unique to specific software. And unlike Python, Ruby or JavaScript it is quick and tiny: the entire interpreter is 32k LOC. It comes with proper development tooling: a formatter and a language server. I hope to use it in my projects someday, but for now I am just enjoying the great software.</div></article></main><footer><hr><div id=footer-container><p>Made using <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=https://github.com/Speyll/anemone target=_blank>anemone</a> Zola theme.<p><a title="face icons" href=https://www.flaticon.com/free-icons/face>Face icons created by Freepik - Flaticon</a><p>Â© 2018-2025 Eugene Babichenko</div></footer><script defer src=https://eugene-babichenko.github.io/js/script.js></script>
