This post may be updated in the future and is also for my own convenience when I need to set up everything on another machine.<p><img alt="This is how it looks" src=/assets/2019-06-13-terminal-screenshot.png><h2 id=terminal-emulator>Terminal emulator</h2><p>I have been using <a href=https://www.iterm2.com>iTerm2</a> on a Mac for quite a long time until I found myself not using most of its features, so now I am fine with the default <code>Terminal.app</code>.<h2 id=themes>Themes</h2><p>I am a big fan of <a href=https://ethanschoonover.com/solarized/>Solarized</a> themes and use Solarized Light light most of the day and Solarized Dark if I work in the evening or overnight or in bad lighting conditions.<p>Here is the <a href=https://github.com/tomislav/osx-terminal.app-colors-solarized>GitHub repository</a> with those themes implement for <code>Terminal.app</code> by <a href=https://github.com/tomislav>@tomsilav</a>, iTerm2 has them out-of-the-box.<h2 id=shell>Shell</h2><p>I use <a href=https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/wiki/Installing-ZSH>zsh</a> because I like its features (like autocompletion, shared command history, and many others) and extensibility. I also tried <a href=http://fishshell.com>fish</a> but it lacked some features I needed that time. Maybe, I will give a try once again.<h2 id=plugins>Plugins</h2><p>First off, we need to somehow manage our plugins and <code>zsh</code> don't have such capabilities out-of-the-box. I use <a href=https://github.com/zsh-users/antigen>antigen</a> to manage my plugins but there is a drawback: it is quite slow itself (mostly written in shell script and Perl) and thus the shell start time is a bit slower. I also tried <a href=https://github.com/getantibody/antibody>antibody</a> which is written in Go and thus much faster, but not all of my plugins were working properly when I tried them with antibody and also its syntax is very verbose when it comes to managing plugins bundled with <code>oh-my-zsh</code>.<p><a href=https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh>oh-my-zsh</a> is a configuration framework and a bunch of plugins for <code>zsh</code>. Those include additional autocompletion, coloring man pages and so on.<p>This is an example of how to use <code>antigen</code> and <code>zsh</code> altogether (place this in your <code>~/.zshrc</code> - the main <code>zsh</code> configuration file):<pre class=language-bash data-lang=bash style=color:#c0c5ce;background-color:#2b303b><code class=language-bash data-lang=bash><span style=color:#96b5b4>source</span><span> /usr/local/share/antigen/antigen.zsh
