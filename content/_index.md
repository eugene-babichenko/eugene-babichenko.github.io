# Eugene Babichenko

Building things for real people. Posting tips and tricks. Sharing thoughts on
the software world.

## Projects

- [fixit](https://github.com/eugene-babichenko/fixit). A super quick utility
  that fixes mistakes in your console commands. Inspired by
  [The Fuck](https://github.com/nvbn/thefuck), but designed to be _much_ faster,
  and to not have any additional dependencies like Python.
- [rust-fsm](https://github.com/eugene-babichenko/rust-fsm). Self-documenting
  macros for easy state machine design in Rust.
