This page will serve to collect small (or not so small) things I like to use and
think it would be good to share with you. Console utilities, hardware, whatever.

## Console utilitites

* [thefuck](https://github.com/nvbn/thefuck). A utility that corrects mistyped
  console commands and do something more: propose you to install what is not
  installed. It also allows you to create your own correction rules.
* [pjson](http://igorgue.com/pjson/). Reads JSON/XML inputs and gives you
  pretty-printed outputs. Especially good when combined with `curl`.
* [pandoc](https://pandoc.org/index.html). A great tool to convert documents
  from any format to any other format.
* [wscat](https://github.com/websockets/wscat). A very simple utility to
  debug WebSockets.

## Utilities with GUI

* [CopyClip](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/copyclip-clipboard-history/id595191960).
  A macOS-specific tool that gives you access to the clipboard history.
  Accessible from the system tray. Has hotkeys. Downside: text-only.
* [Portainer](https://portainer.io). Just the best UI for Docker so far. Helps
  you manage containers, images, volumes and networks. Works pretty fast even
  though the UI is web-based.

## zsh

* [zsh](https://www.zsh.org) itself. The most convenient shell for me so far.
* [antigen](https://github.com/zsh-users/antigen). The best way to configure
  zsh so far. Supports oh-my-zsh
* [pure](https://github.com/sindresorhus/pure). Nice and convenient zsh prompt
  with git integration.
* [zsh-autosuggestions](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions).
  Suggests the command as you type. The suggestion is accepted by pressing the
  right arrow button.
* [zsh-completions](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-completions). An extension
  for autocompletion in zsh.
* [fast-syntax-highlighting](https://github.com/zdharma/fast-syntax-highlighting).
  Good syntax highlighting system for zsh.
